Ishimura - The Spaceship That I Miss

I don't like horror games and therefore I was pretty skeptical about Dead Space at first. To get most out of it, I decided to play this game on Friday night... I didn't sleep that night. I have finished both Dead Space and Dead Space 2 in 2016 and whenever I watch a movie, play a game or see an image or a poster that involves a space, I instantly remember Dead Space. I love games. Dead Space is one of my favorites.
